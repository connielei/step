      <p>
          I'm a sophomore studying CS at Cornell! I started my journey in high school where I was required to take an introductory to computer science course. 
          From there I took the second introductory course, then APCS and some electives. I also participated in Kode With Klossy and CS4CS! In my freshman year of college,
          I joined a project team called Design Tech Initiative, more specifically, the Research Connect subteam which wanted to help undergraduates with research opportunities.
          I changed subteams to Queue Me In the following year. I also took a functional programming class and learned OCaml and became a teaching assistant for the class.

                virtual reality experience of the TriWizard Maze
            </a>
          . It was my first experience
          with VR and felt extremely immersive and real.
